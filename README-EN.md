# Dijkstra Project
    
## Project Description
The project aims to develop a software application that implements the Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The app will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a particular focus on the user interface and clear presentation of the output.

## Main Features
1. **Graph Input:** Allow users to input or generate a graph with nodes and edge weights.
2. **Select Nodes:** Enable users to select two starting and destination nodes.
3. **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implement the Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between the selected nodes.
4. **Result Visualization:** Clearly display the calculated shortest path and its length.
5. **Intuitive User Interface:** Create a clear and easy-to-use interface, emphasizing readability and user experience.

### Interface Draft
A very clean interface with various buttons arranged on the sides of the screen to perform various functions within the program. [Example Graph Nodes](https://her0-github.github.io/progetto-dijkstra/)
